# Learning Curve Initiative

Repo for building a framework for highlighting negative data

The pilot initiative focuses mainly on the computational biophysics community.
This repo serves as a discussion medium. The repo has adapted the LiveCoMs style to facilitate discussions and community outreach. All the discussions are hosted in the issue tracker section. All the document templates are adapted from [LiveCoMs article templates](https://github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates)
